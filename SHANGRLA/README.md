# SHANGRLA
This element of the Boulder County RCV RLA code is sourced from the work of Philip B. Stark, and the repository maintained by him: https://github.com/pbstark/SHANGRLA
### Version Guidance
Two versions are maintained here, under the 2020 and 2023 directories. 
Initial development efforts focused on the 2020 codebase, however updates and changes in August and guidance from the repository maintainer indicated that the current / main brach (as of August 2023) should be used. 
* The 2020 code is sourced from the SHANGRLA **primaries** branch: https://github.com/pbstark/SHANGRLA/tree/primaries.
* The 2023 code is sourced from the SHANGRLA **main** branch: https://github.com/pbstark/SHANGRLA/tree/primaries.

Only the 2023 version has gone through full tests with Boulder County UAT data.
