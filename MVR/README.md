# Manual Vote Recorder (MVR) Tool
This Manual Vote Recorder (MVR) tool is the product of work by Dan King, and sourced from https://github.com/dan-king/RLA-MVR.

This tool provides two functions in support of the Boulder County Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) Risk Limiting Audit (RLA) process:
* The core marking tool uses data sampling data generated by the SHANGRLA workbook, https://github.com/Rule4Inc/BoCo-RCV-RLA/blob/main/SHANGRLA/2023/BC-RLA.ipynb, specifically the CSV Sample file. The random sample of ballots indicated by the sample are retrieved (paper ballots), and cast votes are entered into the tool (sample ballot by sample ballot) to ultimately be compared with the Dominion CVR in support of the audit. The CVR is not presented until after the manual vote record has been populated and submitted. The tool ultimately produces a file, `mvr_ballots.json` with the results of the MVR process for comparison with the CVR. Use of the MVR output and decision making occurs in the SHANGRLA tool/notebook.
* This MVR tool, which runs a web server, is used to serve a Boulder County-modified version of the CVR to RAIRE conversion tool that is used to generate the RAIRE format file from the Dominion CVRs. The modifications in the County file are limited to presenting contest data in JSON format for easy copy and paste entry into the SHANGRLA notebook to reduce the chances of human error.
